                <h1>Javier Erick Gomez Durand</h1>
                <p>I'm a Peruvian developer with 1 year of experience, now I'm living and studying computer science in Russia. I can speak Spanish, Russian and English.</p>
                <p>I started my journey in programming out of a love for video games, and since then I havenâ€™t stopped learning. I'm now expanding my knowledge into full-stack web development.</p>
                <p>I consider myself self-taught, proactive, and I really enjoy working in a team. My goal is to contribute to projects with real purpose and keep growing in this industry.</p>
                <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy music, adventure books, football, I love learning languages and exploring game design.</p>
